<h2 class="p4">PREFACE</h2>


<p>I first visited Huntley in May, 1969 in the company of Edith Sprouse, Joyce
Wilkinson, and Tony Wrenn. Neither I nor anyone else on the staff of the Virginia
Historic Landmarks Commission had ever seen or heard of the house, and my
Fairfax guides were anxious that their "discovery" be brought to our attention.
Having assumed that anything of interest in that section of Fairfax County had long
been swept away for housing developments, I was in no way prepared when
suddenly we rounded a corner and looked up to see a curious geometric structure
sitting placidly among its outbuildings against a wooded hillside, aloof from its
plebian neighbors. A quick scanning of composition and details dissipated any
skepticism I may have had: here, on the outskirts of the capital city was a genuine
Federal villa!</p>

<p>After being graciously escorted throughout the house by the owners, we all
agreed that Huntley was, without question, one of Virginia's undiscovered
architectural treasures. Since next to nothing was known either of its history or the
development of its design, we concluded that the house deserved the most detailed
study. All assumed that a house of such intriguing individuality had to have a story
behind it.</p>

<p>Through the far-sighted patronage of the Fairfax County Government and the
meticulous research of Tony Wrenn, this story has now been pieced together. The
text which follows provides a history and descriptive analysis worthy of this
distinguished Virginia landmark.</p>

<p>This study was undertaken at the request of the Fairfax County History
Commission in 1969, when Mrs. William E. Wilkinson was chairman, and in
cooperation with the Fairfax County Division of Planning.</p>

<p>Colonel and Mrs. Ransom Amlong, owners of Huntley and their son Bill
answered the author's numerous questions and gave him free rein to wander
through the house and site. Edith Moore Sprouse provided frequent research leads
and both E. Blaine Cliver, restoration architect, and Calder Loth, architectural
historian with the Virginia Historic Landmarks Commission, provided architectural
analysis. William Edmund Barrett provided most of the architectural photography.
A major source of material concerning Thomson F. Mason was a collection of his
papers, lent to the Alexandria Library by William Francis Smith for our use. Other
leads were provided by Mrs. Earl Alcorn, Mrs. Sherrard Elliot, Miss Patricia Carey of
the Fairfax County Public Library and Miss Margaret Calhoun of the Alexandria
Library. Mrs. Hugh Cox provided valuable material on T. F. Mason in Alexandria.</p>

<p>Acknowledgment is also due to those who read and made suggestions
concerning the final draft of this report, among them Dr. John Porter Bloom,
Patricia Williams, John Gott, Mrs. Ross Netherton, Julia Weston, and several others
already named above.</p>

<h2 class="p4">INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>It is difficult to understand how a house whose history is closely connected to
the well-known Mason family has existed, practically without notice or mention,
for one hundred and fifty years. This fact is all the more puzzling when the
structure is as architecturally important as "Huntley."</p>

<p>Several possible explanations come to mind:</p>

<blockquote><p>* Though near a major highway, the house is isolated on its hillside site.</p>

<p>* Because the structure has been somewhat altered, close inspection is
necessary before its architectural merits can be fully recognized.</p>

<p>* The house was a country or secondary home for a member of the Mason
family who, though important in his own right, was overshadowed by his
more illustrious father, Thomson Mason of "Hollin Hall", and by his
grandfather, George Mason IV of "Gunston Hall."</p>

<p>* No one has written in detail about the house before and there is little
secondary material available concerning it.</p></blockquote>

<p>Kate Mason Rowland's <i>Life of George Mason</i>, published in 1892,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> gives one of
the few references to Huntley found by the author in secondary sources. In an
appendix titled "Land described in George Mason's will, and now owned by his
descendent's," she notes:</p>

<blockquote><p>It was incorrectly stated in one of the earlier volumes that "Lexington" was
the only one of the Mason places in Virginia now in the family. The writer
had overlooked "Okeley" in Fairfax County, about six miles from
Alexandria. The farms of "Okeley" and "Huntley" were both parts of the
estate bequeathed by George Mason to his son Thomson Mason of "Hollin
Hall." A double ditch<sup>50</sup> is still to be seen on the southern border of these
two places, extending several miles from East to West, with a broad space
about thirty feet wide separating the two ditches. These mark the line
between the lands of George Mason and George Washington, as they were in
the lives of those gentlemen. In General Washington's will he refers "to the
back line or outer boundary of the tract between Thomson Mason and
myself ... now double ditching with a post-and-rail fence thereon," etc. And
he mentions in another place "the new double ditch" in connection with the
boundary line between "Mt. Vernon" and the Mason property. In adding to
his estate he had purchased land at one time from George Mason. And among
the Washington papers preserved in the Lewis and Washington families, and
recently sold to autograph collectors, are three letters of George Mason, on
the subject of the bounds between the Washington and Mason plantations,
one written in 1768, the others in 1769. Washington adds a memorandum to
the former, saying that "the lines to which this letter has reference were
settled by and between Colonel Mason and myself the 19th of April, 1769, as
will appear ... by a survey thereof made on that day in his presence, and
with his approbation." "Huntley" owned by Judge Thomson F. Mason of
"Colross," son of Thomson Mason of "Hollin Hall," passed out of the family
some years ago ...</p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>Another mention is in Edith Moore Sprouse's <i>Potomac Sampler</i>, published in
1961.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> She identifies Huntley as "a part of the estate of George Mason of Gunston
Hall ... on a tract of land which bordered Washington's on the north and stretched
from the Potomac to Kings Highway."</p>

<p>The following study of the Huntley complex combines the work of architects,
architectural historians and historians in reading and interpreting the structures. At
some future date, efforts of archaeologists will probably be rewarded with further
information about the complex at various stages of development.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="center large">THE MASON FAMILY</p>


<p>The first George Mason came to Virginia during the middle of the seventeenth
century.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Two other Georges followed before 1725, when the fourth George
Mason, "The Pen of the Revolution," was born. Movement of the Mason family had
been gradually northward, from Norfolk, then to Stafford and Prince William
Counties in Virginia, across the Potomac River to Charles County, Maryland, and
then back to Fairfax County in Virginia where, in 1758, George Mason IV built
Gunston Hall.</p>

<p>The builder of Gunston Hall was later the author of the Fairfax Resolves, of the
first Constitution of Virginia and of the Virginia Declaration of Rights. His
Declaration of Rights, which was adopted by the Virginia House of Burgesses in
Williamsburg on June 12, 1776, was the major source for the Federal Bill of Rights,
adopted in 1791. Though a delegate to the Constitutional Convention of 1787,
Mason refused to sign the Constitution because it did not provide for the abolition
of slavery, nor did it, in his views, sufficiently safeguard the rights of the
individual.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and other early American leaders were
friends of George Mason and Mason's family surely met many of them at Gunston
Hall. Jefferson, who called George Mason "the wisest man of his generation," was
his last recorded visitor at Gunston Hall, on September 30, 1792.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> On October 7,
one week later, Mason died.</p>

<p>Nine of his children married. On December 17, 1788, George wrote to his son
John that "Your brother Thomson and his family have just moved from Gunston to
his own seat at Hollin Hall."</p>

<p>A tutor of General Thomson Mason's family, Elijah Fletcher, wrote in a letter
from Alexandria, August 4, 1810:</p>

<blockquote><p>[General Mason is] ... a man of note and respectability, his family
very agreeable, social, affable and easy. I use as much freedom in the
family as I did at my fathers house. I doubt not of their kindness to me
in health or sickness. My employment is respectable and I consider my
standing upon a par and equality with most of the people. Our living is
rich and what in Vermont would be called extravagant. The family rise
very late in the morning and consequently do not have breakfast till
eight or nine. Our dinner at three and tea at eight in the evening.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>General Thomson Mason served as an officer of militia in the American
Revolution, held numerous state and local offices and was active in organizing
banks and transportation companies before his death in 1820.</p>

<p>It was his son, Thomson Francis Mason, born in 1785 at Gunston Hall, who built
"Huntley."</p>


<p class="center large p2">Thomson Francis Mason</p>

<p>Thomson Francis Mason was heir to a family tradition of important friendships,
public service and good taste, and he carried on this tradition. Educated at
Princeton, Class of 1807,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> he chose to return to the Fairfax County area to practice
law and enter public service.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>His life story is difficult to trace. No biography exists, nor is he mentioned in
most works concerning Alexandria, even though he later attained significant
recognition there.</p>

<p>On November 24, 1817, the <i>Alexandria Gazette</i> announced the marriage, on
Wednesday evening, November 19th of:</p>

<blockquote><p>Thomson F. Mason, Esq., of this place, to Miss Elizabeth C. Price of
Leesburg, Loudoun County, Virginia....</p></blockquote>

<p>The young Mrs. Mason was familiarly known as Eliza Clapham Price, not as
Elizabeth C., but Thomson F. called her Betsey.</p>

<p>The use of the phrase "of this place" is of interest here, and open to several
interpretations. It could mean that he was living in Alexandria at the time or only
that he had an office there. He could have been living in Alexandria and building a
home in Fairfax County at the same time.</p>

<p>Mason was probably already a practicing lawyer at the time of his marriage and
was by 1824 a man of consequence in Alexandria.</p>

<blockquote><p>The fight to get out of the District began in 1824, while it was not
settled by Congress until 1846. The citizens of Alexandria, becoming
tired of being in the District of Columbia, made an attempt to have
Alexandria receded to Virginia. A meeting was held March 9, 1824, for
the purpose of preparing a memorial to Congress on the subject. S.
Thompson Mason was Chairman of the meeting....<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The memorial sent to Congress was couched in legal enough terms to have been
drafted by Mason, who later became a judge. His political activities gave him
enough local standing to insure his election as Mayor of Alexandria in 1827 and
again in 1836.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>A glimpse of Mason as a family man can be seen in a reply to a letter from his
wife in which she complained of an exchange of words with Huntley's overseer (in
1828), Slighter Smith. Mason, who must have been in court at Leesburg, wrote:</p>

<blockquote><p>I have been indeed a little surprised at hearing the conduct of Mr.
Smith. Altho' I knew about the general unkind and bad temper which
he possessed, I had no idea that he would have ventured to exhibit it in
your presence&mdash;or have him guilty of the insolence of threatening
violence in your presence and to one under your protection.... I still
cannot believe that he would seriously attempt it....</p></blockquote>

<p>In that same letter Mason noted:</p>

<blockquote><p>... the great pleasure and pride I have ever felt in seeing you placed
above the flame, and having you so looked up to by others.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>As a good plantation manager, he also included a note to Smith informing him of
his surprise and displeasure at the outbreak and suggesting:</p>

<blockquote><p>I feel it is proper to inform you that I shall feel it my duty to inquire
strictly into this subject&mdash;And with regard to the threatened violence I
beg leave ... to put you on your guard and to inform you that any new
attempt will be followed by the most serious consequences.</p></blockquote>

<p>Mason lived in several houses in Alexandria (see Appendix A), but it was the
time he spent at Colross which seems to have received the most notice. Mrs. Marian
Gouverneur wrote in her book, <i>As I Remember</i>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Another Virginia family of social prominence, whose members mingled
much in Washington Society, while I was still visiting the Winfield
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>Scotts, was that of the Masons of "Colross," the name of their old
homestead near Alexandria in Virginia. Mrs. Thomson F. Mason was
usually called Mrs. "Colross" Mason to distinguish her from another
family by the same name, that of James M. Mason, United States
Senator from Virginia. The family thought nothing of the drive to
Washington and no entertainment was quite complete without the
"Mason girls," who were especially bright and attractive young women.
Open house was kept at this delightful country seat, and many were the
pleasant parties given there....<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Indeed the Mason occupancy of Colross made such an impression, that for years
afterward the house was known as "The Mason Mansion." During the Civil War, on
October 12, 1864, the <i>Alexandria Gazette</i>, in reporting the military occupation of
the town, carried the following item on Colross:</p>

<blockquote><p>... The fine old Mason mansion, in the suburbs of the town, was hired
by an army officer.... The Mason mansion ... is a fair type of the
residence of a wealthy Virginian. A wide hall in the centre opens into
various rooms, while the front entrance is approached through a
pleasant courtyard. At the rear of the house is a spacious area, paved
with marble in diamond shaped blocks, looking out upon a large
garden, well shaded with fruit trees and surrounded by a heavy brick
wall. At one corner of this garden is the family tomb, in which are the
remains of old Judge Mason, the former owner of the estate, who died
just before the war broke out. He was a near relative of the present
Confederate Commissioner to England, and his widow now resides at
Point of Rocks....</p></blockquote>

<p>Colross remained in the Mason family until the 1880's, Mrs. Betty Carter Smoot,
Alexandria historian, who lived at Colross, wrote in 1934, of the house and family:</p>

<blockquote><p>Jonathan Swift and his wife, and the Masons, who for many years
resided at Colross, are said to have lived in great style and elegance. As
regarded the Masons, there were still some evidences of this when we
went there. Although pretty well denuded of its furnishings, there were
one or two fine old mahogany pieces which had not been removed, and
some handsome mirrors, with gilded frames, of a size appropriate to the
surroundings. In the garret was stored quantities of china, remains of
dinner sets, some in white and gold and others in blue willow pattern.
There were some beautiful old cut glass decanters, wine glasses, and
goblets. I remember also some vases and other bric-a-brac. Much of this
was mutilated, but it furnished a fair sample of the style of living
maintained in palmy days of the past. These belongings of the Masons
were all packed, under the supervision of a daughter of the family, Miss
Caroline Mason, and disposed of by her.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>When Thomson F. Mason died on December 21, 1838, his obituary in the
<i>Alexandria Gazette</i> ran two full columns.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> It was noted that Mason, who was a
Judge of the Criminal Court of the District of Columbia at the time of his death,
had:</p>

<blockquote><p>... graduated at Princeton with the highest honors of that
institution ... studied law and practiced with much success and
celebrity, until he was elevated by the Executive of the United States to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>that Station on the Bench, which he filled with such ability at the time
of his decease ... his services were eminently valuable not only in the
character of Chief Magistrate of their City (Alexandria), the duties of
which he discharged for many years, but in all their public
undertakings....</p></blockquote>

<p>That same issue of the <i>Gazette</i> carried resolutions of the Common Council of
Alexandria decreeing that they would:</p>

<blockquote><p>... attend his funeral, and will wear crape on the left arm for one
month.... That, as a further mark of respect, and to evince the sense of
his community of their loss, the great bell in the public building be
tolled on Sunday next, from 1 o'clock P.M., till half past 4 P.M....</p></blockquote>

<p>Members of the Bar and Officers of the Courts of Alexandria County voted to:</p>

<blockquote><p>... attend his funeral ... and wear the usual badge of mourning for
thirty days ... that a committee of three be appointed respectively to
tender them [family] our condolence ... that the proceeding of the
meeting be published in the <i>Alexandria Gazette</i>....</p></blockquote>

<p>The Bar and Officers of the Circuit Court of the District of Columbia voted to:</p>

<blockquote><p>... attend his funeral, and, during the residue of the term, wear the
usual badges of mourning ... that the Chairman [Francis Scott Key]
with Richard Coxe and Alexander Hunter, Esqrs., be a Committee to
tender to the family of the deceased the sympathy of this meeting at
the death of one endeared to us by long acquaintance, which has made
known the character of the deceased as one deserving of our warmest
personal regard and highest respect, and which rendered this event a
great public loss, as well as a private affliction....</p></blockquote>

<p>T. F. Mason had been appointed to the newly organized Criminal Court of the
District of Columbia less than six months before his death. He was the first judge
appointed to that court, and its only judge during its formative period. As a Justice
of Peace he had received his first appointment in February 1828, and was
reappointed in 1833, and 1838.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>The story of Mason's life presented here is only a partial one but it is included to
show something of the type of man who built Huntley.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="center large">HUNTLEY AND ITS OWNERS</p>


<p class="center medium p2">Location and Site</p>

<p>Huntley, 6918 Harrison Lane, near Woodlawn Plantation, Fairfax County,
Virginia, is currently owned by Colonel and Mrs. Ransom G. Amlong. It is located
off the Jefferson Davis Highway (U.S. Route 1), in the Groveton community, on
Harrison Lane, between Lockheed Boulevard and Kings Highway (Route 633).</p>

<p>The house is on a plateau, overlooking Hybla Valley, at 150 feet above sea level.
To the south, or in front of the house, the ground level drops in three terraces to
130 feet above sea level. To the north or rear there is a sharp rise to 200 feet.</p>

<p>A church and several houses are located directly in front of Huntley, but the
vista from the house toward the Potomac River, especially in summer, is relatively
undisturbed. The general area is one of intense commercial and residential
development. Hybla Valley, through which Barnyard Creek flows from Huntley,
constitutes the major part of the view from the house, and much of this land is
owned by the U.S. Government.</p>

<blockquote><p>The Huntley complex consists of:</p>

<p>
1. The mansion house.<br />
2. Necessary with flanking storage rooms.<br />
3. Root cellar.<br />
4. Ice house.<br />
5. Spring house.<br />
6. Tenant house.<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>All the buildings are brick. The house itself is a significant Federal period
structure, built during the ownership of Thomson F. Mason, c. 1820, and believed
to have been influenced by George Hadfield, architect of Washington's first City
Hall and first superintendent of the Capitol's construction.</p>


<p class="center medium p2">Origin of the Name</p>

<p>The first known use of "Huntley" as a place name for the Harrison Lane house
appears in an 1859 deed of the property by Betsey C. Mason, widow of T.F. Mason,
to her sons John Francis and A. Pendleton Mason. The property is described as:</p>

<blockquote><p>... all that certain tract of land in the County of Fairfax and state of
Virginia called "Huntley" and containing about one thousand acres....<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>It is probable that the plantation was named Huntley before Thomson F. Mason
died in 1838, although his will of that year mentions no real estate, or personal
property specifically.</p>

<p>If he followed the Mason tradition, the house may have been named after an
ancestral home in England, and probably after the home of a maternal ancestor. In
writing of Gunston Hall, Helen Hill Miller says:</p>

<blockquote><p>They called their home "Gunston Hall." The name had come down
through several generations of Mason's maternal ancestry: his
grandmother was Mary Fowke of Gunston Hall in Charles County,
Maryland, and her grandfather was the Gerald Fowke of Gunston Hall
in Staffordshire who emigrated to Virginia at the same time as the first
George Mason. The habit of naming new homes in America after the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>old ones in England was general among the planters of the Virginia
Tidewater. Mason conformed to this tradition for a second time when
he made a gift of a nearby plantation to his son Thomson and called it
"Hollin Hall," after the home of his mother's people near Ripon....<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>If Thomson F. Mason had followed the same procedure he could have used the
name "Huntley," which might at any point have had an "e" added. His father was
General Thomson Mason of Hollin Hall, who was married to Sarah McCarty
Chichester.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Sarah was the daughter of Richard McCarty Chichester, whose first
wife had been Ann Gordon.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> The ancestral Gordon home in Scotland was called
"Huntley."</p>

<blockquote><p>In these lands of Strathbogie Sir Adam (Adam the V) fixed his
residence, and was the first of the Gordons who removed from the
south of Scotland to the North. He obtained from the parliament
holden at Perth anno 1311, that his new estate should be called <i>Huntley</i>,
as it is still called in writings and public instruments, altho' amongst the
vulgar it retains the old name of Strathbogie.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p></blockquote>


<p class="center large p2">OWNERS AND OCCUPANTS</p>

<p class="center medium">Mason Ownership</p>

<p>The will of General Thomson Mason of Hollin Hall was written on April 15,
1797, and probated, after his death, on November 21, 1820.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> That will does not
specifically mention real estate, but does:</p>

<blockquote><p>... give and devise unto my Son Thomason Mason my gold watch and I
confirm unto him his right and title to a mulatto boy named Bill, given
him by his Grandfather Mr. Richard Chichester and I also give and devise
unto him my interest in the Potomack Company....</p></blockquote>

<p>One reason no real estate is specifically mentioned may be cleared up by a later
deed (1823)<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> in which other heirs of General Mason deed to:</p>

<blockquote><p>Thomson F. Mason of the Town of Alexandria in the District of
Columbia, ... a certain tract of land situate in the County of Fairfax
and State of Virginia known and called by the name of Hunting Creek
Farm....</p></blockquote>

<p>This deed reaffirms settlements made by General Mason during his lifetime on
January 1, 1817, and includes the land on which Huntley is located.</p>

<p>Thomson F. could have begun Huntley at any time after January 1, 1817. On
the 29th of January 1818, he paid Alexander Baggett $37.79-1/2 for, among other
things:</p>

<blockquote><p>
40&nbsp; Ft. Double Architrave<br />
18&nbsp; Ft. Jamb lining<br />
1&nbsp; Carpet strip<br />
2&nbsp; pr hinges put on<br />
1&nbsp; mortice lock put on<br />
2&nbsp; Flush Bolts<br />
135&nbsp; Ft 4/4 clear boards<br />
&nbsp;locks, hinges, bolts, nails, and Springs....<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a><br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>Also included is one item labeled "folding doors" (double doors). No double
doors have been located at Huntley, although Mason is not known to have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
building elsewhere at this period. During the latter part of 1819 he was still building
and paid $28.00 for:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Sept 20&mdash;20 bushels plaster<br />
Sept 22&mdash;20 bushels plaster<br />
Oct 10&mdash;10 bushels plaster....<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a><br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>There was probably a structure at Huntley by 1823, for in February of that year
Mason sent "to his farm by surry ten bushels shoots and six bran...."<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>By 1826 the house must have been substantially finished, for in that year
Mason's Grandmother Chichester wanted:</p>

<blockquote><p>to spend a few days at Mr. T.F. Mason's farm, but was deterred from
doing so by the apprehension that, as Mr. Mason resided in Town, and
there was no other white person on the farm but the overseer ... she
would not be secure.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>By implication there was a dwelling at Huntley ready for her occupancy.</p>

<p>Another letter written to Mason on August 18, 1827, now incomplete and in
poor condition, suggests finishing some construction work and notes that the
writer, whose name is missing:</p>

<blockquote><p>... had understood you had only rented the place by the month, tho
the man has a little crop on the land growing and if the season proves
good at the end of the year may be worth ... [the rest is missing]<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Almost a year later the <i>Alexandria Gazette</i>, on Thursday morning August 5,
1828, had an advertisement offering:</p>

<blockquote><p>$25 Reward/ran away from the farm of Thompson F. Mason/Fairfax
County on the night of 2d instant negro/BOB. He is about 6 feet high,
stout made, very black/and about 45 years of age; has a stammering in
his/speech; his right leg sore. Had on when he eloped,/brown linen shirt
and trowsers and took with him/blue coat, white linsey trowsers, and

County. If taken out of the County/or District of Columbia,
$25./Slighter Smith, Agent for Thompson F. Mason/Fairfax County,
State of Virginia/August 5.</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Smith had been replaced as Overseer at Huntley by 1832 for in that year
Price Skinner wrote:</p>

<blockquote><p>... being moved to your house last friday&mdash;we are in a bad fix&mdash;I want
you if you please to ride out to see what you will have don&mdash;if I was
you I wood have the floor layed down with the plank not used&mdash;the

<p>Mason had already acquired Colross, in Alexandria (see Appendix A.), by 1833, for
in March of that year an estimate was submitted by Thos. Beale for:</p>

Town of Alexandria....</p></blockquote>

Mason had written in his will:</p>

<blockquote><p>... I devise all my estate real and personal in possession remainder or
reversion or in expectancy to my beloved wife B.C.M. for her
maintenance and support of our children during her life and
widowhood.... For any aid or assistance which my wife may require in
the management of my estate, I recommend her to my brother Richard
C. Mason, and my most excellent friends Benjamin King and Bernard
Hooe....</p></blockquote>

<p>Though Thomson F. Mason had built Huntley, it never served as his permanent
residence. It was occupied by a succession of renters, overseers and farmers.
Mason's "excellent friend Benjamin King," a doctor, was to have a more personal
connection with Huntley, however.</p>


<p class="center p2 medium">King Ownership</p>

<p>In November of 1859, Betsey C. Mason, having been authorized:</p>

<blockquote><p>... by deed or will, to dispose of all or any part of his estate to their
children or any of them, at such times and in such proportions as she
may think just and prudent, and whereas, the said Betsey C. Mason
deems if just and prudent to dispose of a portion of said estate to her
said sons [John Francis and A. Pendleton] ... all that certain tract of

and containing about one thousand acres....<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>At the same time Mrs. Mason transferred to her two sons:</p>

<blockquote><p>... eighty five negroes, slaves for life, which said negroes are
particularly mentioned and set forth in the scheduled annexes to this
deed ... Daniel Humphreys and his wife Rachel and their son Daniel,

<p>Of the 85 more than six may have lived at Huntley, but only these six are specified.</p>

<p>Exactly one month later, the two Mason boys, being:</p>

thousand dollars, lawful money of the United States, to be paid to the
said Benjamin King on the first day of January one thousand eight

<p>There the ownership remained until the Civil War. A map of that era (1862)
shows "Huntley Pl&mdash;Mrs. Mason's". The overview is labelled "Wide fertile Valley
with but little Timber."<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> This map also labels Kings Highway the "Gravel Road,"
a term used in many of the Huntley deeds.</p>

<p>Why the Masons became indebted to Benjamin King is not known, but on June
12, 1862, the property was transferred from Smith to King. According to the deed
they did:</p>

<blockquote><p>... advertise the said property in the Alexandria News, a paper
published in the City of Alexandria, for upwards of thirty days for sale
at public auction and wheras pursuant to said advertisement the said
John A. Smith did on Thursday, the 12th day of June, 1862, at 12
o'clock a.m. in front of the Mayor's office in the City of Alexandria,
offer at public sale to the highest bidder ... several bids having been
made therefor, the said property was struck off to Benjamin King at
and for the sum of thirteen thousand dollars ... that certain tract of
land known as "Huntley" ... together with all and singular the
appurtenances thereto....<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>As nearly as can be determined no <i>Alexandria News</i> was being published at the
time, and the property was not advertised in the <i>Gazette</i>. The transaction was
noted in its "Local News";</p>

<blockquote><p>... the property known as "Huntley" in Fairfax County, containing
about 1,000 acres, was sold today at public auction by John A. Smith,
esq., Trustee. It was subject to a lien of about $10,000, and was
purchased by Dr. Benjamin King, subject to said lien, for $13,000
cash.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Evidently King either already had moved to Huntley, or did at that time. He
next appeared in the <i>Gazette</i> when he was leaving the property in 1868.</p>

<blockquote><p>For sale on Tuesday the 19th instant at 10 o'clock a.m. at "Huntley"

<p class="center p2 medium">Harrison-Pierson Ownership</p>

<p>Dr. King sold Huntley to Albert W. Harrison and Nathan W. Pierson of New
Jersey. The instrument of sale provided:</p>

<blockquote><p>... the tract hereby conveyed containing eight hundred and ninety and
one half acres, more or less, known as and commonly called
"Huntley"....<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>The deed more specifically noted that the courses in this deed had been so changed
as:</p>

<blockquote><p>... to make them conform to the ancient surveys of the land, and being
the same land which was surveyed by George and others to Thomson F.
Mason, by deed dated October 1st, eighteen hundred and twenty
three ...</p></blockquote>

<p>Accompanying the deed was a survey which was accomplished for Dr. King by
Thomas W. Carter, "formerly surveyor, Prince William County." The survey was
received by the County Clerk on May 15, 1868. The "Gravel Road" was shown as
running north of the "Mansion House," and the "South Branch Little Hunting
Creek" east of the house. The Huntley part of the purchase was shown as a plot of
land with 682 acres, 0 rods and 30 poles, containing the "Mansion House."</p>

<p>The "Journal of Records of Huntley Farm," covering the period between
1868-89, is currently in the possession of Mrs. Earl Alcorn of Alexandria. It details
the purchase, subsequent division between Pierson and Harrison, payment of liens,
etc., on Huntley. The Journal indicates that the farm was actually purchased on
March 1, 1868. Dr. King was probably given time to settle his affairs, as the transfer
was not recorded until November of that year. At any rate, the Journal entry for
March 1, 1868, reads:</p>

<blockquote><p>
956 acres at $32.50 per acre<span style="margin-left: 6.5em;">31,070.00</span><br />
Paid down each $5,000<span style="margin-left: 8.5em;">10,000.00</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 17.5em;">21,070.00</span><br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>The Harrisons obviously entered into community affairs, for by May 1870:</p>

<blockquote><p>The regular monthly meeting of the Woodlawn Farmers' Club was held
on Saturday last pursuant to adjournment at Huntley, the residence of
A.W. Harrison. The President being absent, Courtland Lukens was
appointed Chairman pro tem. Twenty four members were present.
Theron Thompson was admitted as a member. The report of the
committee on vegetables and a supplement for March last was called
for, again read, and discussed at some length. The committee on cereals
presented their report on the condition of things about the farm and
premises of Huntley, which was a good one and rather commendatory
of Mr. Harrison as a practical farmer, and elicited several pertinent
questions and answers. Some discussion ensued as to the best method
of ridding farms of garlic. E. E. Mason produced several "pips" taken
dexterously with the thumb nail from under the tongue of young
chickens. The "pip" is a little boney substance similar to a fish scale, a
negative of the tongue, and prevents the chick from eating unless it is
removed. A conversational style of discussion ensured on the subject of
poultry. An invitation to supper, as usual, was unanimously accepted
without debate. The club then adjourned to meet one month hence at
Edward Daniels' [Gunston Hall].<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In the 1870 census Harrison was recorded as being 36 years old, having four
daughters, real estate worth $28,000 and personal property worth $8,000.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>Harrison became a well known citizen. The <i>Alexandria Gazette</i> reported on
March 3, 1870, that "Mr. Harrison's horses ran away," causing great excitement in
the city.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>


<p class="center p2 medium">Harrison Ownership</p>

<p>Pierson and Harrison divided the Huntley tract on March 11, 1871,<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> and by the

<p>In 1875 "A.F.B.", evidently a correspondent for the <i>Syracuse</i> (N.Y.) <i>Journal</i>,
visited Huntley, and on July 25th filed a dispatch to the <i>Journal</i>. The story
indicated much about life at Huntley during the era, including the marks left by the
Civil War and the life of the Northerners who had moved to the South:</p>

<blockquote><p>To come to Huntley you take the steamer from Washington to
Alexandria. The cars run hourly or nearly so, but the river ride is more
pleasant. If you have been to Alexandria at any time since the century
opened, you will recognize the place. Many things change in three score
years and fifteen, but Alexandria is not one of them. It is the same
yesterday and today. Your hospitable friends at Huntley will meet you
on the wharf, and you shall have a charming ride through the Fairfax
fair fields for four miles, until you reach the Old Dominion plantation
of Judge Mason. It joins on the south Mt. Vernon, which is plainly
visible from the ancient family residence of the Masons, now the home
of an enterprising eastern gentleman, who has a fondness for agriculture
on a grand scale. The house stands boldly on a hill spur, looking over
broad acres of corn, rye, wheat, oats, and fertile meadows&mdash;a sight to
see. Beyond, in plain vision, rolls the Potomac. Vessels of many kinds&mdash;by
sail and by steam&mdash;are going to and from the city of Washington....
We took a walk today over the great farm. I dare not say how many
were the acres of corn standing eleven and twelve feet high, with
tasseled ears. Our host had us through the meadows, going like Boaz of
old among his men. He speaks well of the ex-slaves, and of their service.
Among them I met a Washington and an Andrew Jackson....</p>

<p>As we walked on into shady woods we came upon an old encampment
of our Union Forces in the war. If fruit and berries were as abundant
then as now, the boys in blue had a good time in their season. Nor
could the weather have been peculiarly trying. At night we get the west
winds from off the Alleghanies, and at times the delicious coolness of
the sea-side is rivaled. I counted as many as thirty open graves here
from which the forms of those who had been buried had been taken
away. Trees are growing in the places of the tents, and time is fast
sweeping away the marks of war.</p>

<p>The Southern people are not considered by these northern farmers
especially unfriendly. There is little social intercourse, however, because
the women got so thoroughly mad, that they will never get over it in
this world.... Nevertheless, there is such a sprinkling of Yankees in
these parts that life here has its social attractions.</p>

<p>The farmers' clubs meet statedly to picnic, to discuss, and to prove that
the lines have fallen to them in pleasant places. And a better home for a
farmer can scarcely be imagined. The winter is short; the spring early;
the summer not oppressive, and the autumn continuous, rich and
glorious. The people catch the inspiration and are "given to
hospitality." One could do much worse than to live at Huntley. As for
us, we are coming again.</p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>In May, 1892, the <i>Gazette</i> reported another meeting of the Woodlawn Farmers'
Club at Huntley, though the column was a little garble, noting that the Club:</p>

<blockquote><p>... met at Huntley, the residence of Mrs. Pierson.... The farm of our
hostess consists of about 300 acres and is part of the estate formerly
owned by Mrs. Thomson Mason. A new cottage has been built
overlooking a fertile valley, and giving a fine prospect including the
Potomac River, Mt. Vernon, Woodlawn and Belvoir estates and is
carried on by Harry Pierson, son of our former President.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The Pierson House may be the structure directly across Harrison Lane from
Huntley. It has the same outlook and general location as Huntley, and is located on
part of the original Huntley tract.</p>

<p>Albert W. Harrison, to whom Huntley had passed in 1868, died in 1911. The
<i>Gazette</i> noted that:</p>

<blockquote><p>Mr. Albert W. Harrison, an old, well known and esteemed resident of
Fairfax County, died at his home "Huntley" in the Woodlawn
neighborhood at 7:30 o'clock last night. The deceased was 80 years old.
He leaves four children, a son and three daughters. Mr. Harrison was a
native of Montclair, New Jersey, but moved to Fairfax County in 1869.
His frequent visits to this city for more than forty years made him as
well known in Alexandria as any resident of the City. Mr. Harrison was
a member of the Second Presbyterian Church. His funeral will take
place Saturday afternoon at the residence. The interment will be in
Alexandria.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>On April 5, 1911 the married daughter, Margaret N. Harrison Gibbs, and her
husband J. Norman Gibbs, deeded:</p>

<blockquote><p>... all of their right, title and interest, legal and equitable in and to the
personal estate of said Albert W. Harrison, deceased, except his watch,
and also to hold as tenants in common, the following described tract of
land containing three hundred fifty eight and three quarters (358 3/4)
being part of "Huntley" so called and known ...<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>to Clara B. Harrison, unmarried; Mary C. Harrison, unmarried, and Albert R.
Harrison, unmarried. The part of the Huntley tract transferred contained the house.</p>

<p>For the next 19 years neither the Harrisons nor Huntley seem to have made the
news. Then in 1930, a full page <i>Alexandria Gazette</i> article appeared entitled
"Nation's Greatest Air Center."<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> The rest of the headline read:</p>

<blockquote><p>George Washington Air Junction Tract Found Ideal for Trans-Atlantic
Terminal for Airships of Zeppelin and R-101 types without Interfering
with Thousand-Acre Airport for Planes&mdash;Admiral Chester Shows That
Historic Ancestral Lands of George Washington and George Mason,
First Selected by War Department 12 Years Ago for Army Aviation
Field, Afford Only Tract Ideal for Great National Air Center.</p></blockquote>

<p>The "only ideal tract" was the valley in front of Huntley. Admiral Chester was
reported as saying that the War Department in 1916-17, made an investigation:</p>

<blockquote><p>... of all possible sites for an Army Aviation field near Washington, and
found that the Air Junction site was the only ideal site for a large air
center.</p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<hr class="chap" />
<p>Public Relations men for the Air Junction certainly used local history as a
promotional gimmick:</p>

<blockquote><p>It will be a twentieth century aeronautic, scientific and historic center,
but retaining the gorgeous 18th Century pastoral setting, including
beautiful groves that teem with birdlife ... a dozen bubbling springs
that have been making for centuries the sparkling Little Hunting Creek
and Dogue Creek.... There are many other alluring surprises that one
would not dream of finding within only nine miles from the Capital,
such as Mason's poetic "Huntley," a gem of colonial architecture,
surrounded by stately trees. George Mason's "Huntley" and "Okeley"
are both part of the George Washington Air Junction. These
estates ... had been forgotten, due to the lack of signs on the
Washington-Richmond Highway to make known that a modest lane led
to them. The lane has now been widened into a 50 foot gravel road and
has become the entrance to the Air Junction.</p>

<p>As the visitors drive into the Junction, past the historic Little Hunting
Creek, about 3,000 feet westward, they behold "Huntley," a gem of
colonial architecture, which graces one of the hills on the north side of
the Washington Air Junction Drive and overlooks the Thousand Acres
Airport. It is surrounded by stately trees, and its sides are screened by
vines and picturesque thick bushes of lilacs, roses and other flowers.</p>

<p>"May I carry it away?" is the usual query from visitors, as from the
distance "Huntley" looks small enough to carry away. Failing to obtain
permission to remove this colonial gem, the visitors feel happy in being
photographed on the quaint porch and steps....</p></blockquote>

<p>The writer had apparently convinced himself of at least one thing, for under the
photograph of Huntley, which accompanies the article, the house is again called "a
gem of colonial architecture."</p>

<p>Air Junction promoters invited the Graf Zeppelin and subsequent airships to
make their base here rather than at Lakehurst, New Jersey. The same invitation
went to the British and to others, but the accidental burning of the Hindenburg at
Lakehurst on May 6, 1937, seems to have put an end to dreams of a great airship
junction at Huntley, though there was an operative airport there. Such names as
Lockheed Boulevard, Fairchild Drive, Piper Lane, Beechcraft Drive and Fordson
Road still survive.</p>


<p class="center medium p2">Later Owners</p>

<p>Albert R. Harrison, still unmarried and last of the Harrison children, died on

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="center large">AN ARCHITECTURAL DESCRIPTION<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>


<p>The buildings currently comprising the Huntley complex include the mansion
house, the tenant house, the storage and necessary house, the ice house, the root
cellar and the spring house.</p>


<p class="center p2 medium">The Dwelling or Mansion House</p>

<p>Huntley, the mansion house, is of brick construction. The brick is laid in
common, or American, bond, with five courses of stretchers to one of headers.
Average brick size is eight and three-eights inches by four inches by two and
one-quarter inches thick.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> "The brickwork does not seem to have been laid
ornamentally, but this is not strange for a building of the early part of the
nineteenth century, where the emphasis was taken away from brick and it was
often either stuccoed or painted."<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>


<p class="center p2 medium">Room Arrangement</p>

<p>Originally the house was "H" shaped. The center portion is three stories at the
front (south), two at the rear, and only one room deep. The wings on either side are
two stories at the front, one at the rear and two rooms deep. Construction of the
house on the slope of the hill accounts for the difference in height. Major entrances
are on the first floor, although a ground floor is located beneath it. The wings
project about half their width front and rear from the center section. This
arrangement provides a large center room at the first floor level, with two rooms on
each side. On the second floor level there is only one large center room, while on
the ground floor level there is a large center room with two flanking rooms on each
side. Here were the kitchen, various storage rooms, and possibly quarters for the
household staff.</p>

<p>Every room on the first floor and almost every room on the ground floor had an
exterior entrance. There is no obvious physical evidence to indicate the means of
access to the second story room. Evidence of a dumbwaiter from the ground floor
kitchen area to the floor above still exists in the rear ground floor room of the west
wing.</p>

<p>A wing has been added to the rear portion of the west side of the house. This is
partly brick and partly frame and is of relatively recent construction. The rear of
the H-shaped building has been filled in to create a hall space, bath and an enclosed
stair to the second floor room. At the second floor level it provides an extra room
and a bath. This work is probably nineteenth century, but the exact date is
unknown.</p>

<p>In front, at the first floor level is a porch addition. This is built around earlier
steps which are of quarried stone supported by a brick wall on each side. The
present porch roof covers and obscures the brick arch and top of the fanlight over
the entrance. There was probably no covered porch on the house originally.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2 medium center">Windows and Doors</p>

<p>Windows in the facade are unique in that they are set into recessed brick frames.
While the frames in the root cellar are arched, those in the residence are square
panels, with the window set into the center of the frame. According to architectural
historian E. Blaine Cliver, the exterior window construction is quite simple with a
double beaded frame set into the brick two to three inches from the front surface.
The simplicity of the window framing, which is Federal in style, would place the
house somewhat after the late Colonial period, in the early nineteenth century.
Windows on the ground and first floor are six-over-six, double-hung sash, except
adjacent to the entrance on the first floor porch where they are four-over-four.
Windows on the second floor consist of a single, nine-pane sash, which opens to the
side on hinges. The pane size is eight and a half inches by ten inches and a large
portion of the glass is early. The exterior shutters consist of a single panel of fixed
louvers and much shutter hardware survives. This includes several types of shutter
stops, which are generally wrought rather than stamped. A fine boot scraper also
exists at the rear first floor entrance.</p>

<p>The door entrance in the south front has framing sidelights and an elliptical
fanlight with wood tracery. In general, the oval fanlight came into use in the 1790's
and went out of common use around 1825; although according to Mr. Cliver it
probably was not common in this area until after 1800. The stiles of the entrance
are basically the pilaster type although the reeding within the pilaster is rounded
rather than flat. An opposing door at the north or rear of the center room was also
originally exterior. The keystone over the fanlight has a beaded center portion
which is similar to those found in the work of nineteenth century architect Asher
Benjamin.</p>


<p class="center p2 medium">Interior Features</p>

<p>The center first floor room has a fine mantel which is also similar in proportion
to the Federal styles of Benjamin. The mantel is somewhat busy, and a little heavy,
yet it has delicate detail and reeding on the sides. The mantels in the side rooms are
much simpler, as might be expected in ancillary rooms. Basically, however, their
proportions are the same, dateable to the early nineteenth century but with much
less style involved. All four of the side mantels are of the same basic design, but
each has been given an individual detail or refinement.</p>

<p>The second floor room has a simple mantel and moldings. It has the ovolo curve
in the molding around the architraves which was common in the eighteenth century
and persisted into the nineteenth.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> This room would have been less used than
downstairs rooms and the moldings are bound to be simpler, as is often found in
the nineteenth century, when the upstairs was no longer as much used as in the
eighteenth century. This room has a tray ceiling of the type one would expect to
find beneath a hip roof, such as Huntley had in the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>Much of the flooring in the house is early, consisting of wide random width pine
boards. The saw marks in the subflooring above the ground floor center room are
vertical, but apparently from a mechanical saw. Beams under this portion of the
house are hand-sawn on one side and broad-axed on the other.</p>

<p>On the ground floor only the kitchen fireplace in the west side is open. There is
evidence of a possible oven in the west chimney in the center room. In the east
wing the front fireplace has been closed, though a balancing structural arch in the
adjacent room is still open. The floor on the ground level was brick but floors in all
rooms except the rear room in the east wing have been covered with concrete.</p>

<p>Much early hardware remains at Huntley, some of which fits stylistically into the
period of construction. Most of it cannot be positively dated. The front door latch,
for example, is an old Carpenter-type lock, generally common in the eighteenth and
nineteenth centuries, but having no visible manufacturers mark, it cannot be
positively dated.</p>

<p>Door and window architraves in the center first floor room, and in rooms in the
east wing have corner blocks, while those in the west wing do not. Detail of the
architraves throughout is early, and those with corner blocks are probably
contemporary with the rest of the house. In the center room, first floor, the
mantel, door and window architraves, and panelling beneath windows, all have the
same molding details, indicating that all woodwork is of the same age.</p>


<p class="center p2 medium">Exterior Features</p>

<p>On the two wings the wooden cornice is fairly deep, approximately eight inches,
providing a slight projection. This may be indicative of a somewhat later date&mdash;moving
toward the cornices of the Greek Revival period. They are probably of a
later date, but if so, certainly within thirty to forty years after the house was
constructed, or no later than the mid-nineteenth century. The saw-tooth cornice line
does not run behind the present wooden cornice, indicating, along with the fact
that brick bonding continues into the gable end, that the roof configuration on the
wings is probably original. The only probable differences between the original roof
and that now in place is that the gable ends over the center section were clipped,
giving the appearance of a hip roof when seen from the front. This roof continued,
shed style, over the wings. There probably were no covered porches and the front
porch at the first floor level may have been open above and below.</p>


<p class="center p2 medium">The Tenant House</p>

<p>The tenant house is a brick two-story structure with a ridge roof, a slightly
off-center interior chimney and a three bay front. The building is approximately
thirty-two feet long and twenty-two feet wide. A seven foot projection on the right
end, added in this century, houses bath and kitchen facilities. It is approximately
two hundred seventy feet west of the mansion house.</p>

<p>The brick is laid in common bond, with five courses of stretchers to one of
headers. The average brick size is eight and one-half inches by four inches by two
and one-eighth inches. The cornice line is composed of three rows of bricks stepped
outward. The first and third courses are stretchers and the middle course is
composed of headers laid to form a dentil course.</p>

<p>This structure burned in 1947; now only the exterior walls are original. All
windows, doors and interiors date from remodelling after the fire. As part of the
Huntley complex, it is still a visually important building.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p class="center p2 medium">The Storage House and Necessary</p>

<p>The building referred to by the present owners as the slave quarters does not
seem to have been suitable for the housing of human beings, and may actually not
have been used for that purpose. It is a one-story brick structure with a ridge roof
over three rooms. Neither of the end rooms has a finished floor or ceiling nor do
they appear ever to have had finished walls; the windows are wall openings
protected by iron bars; each room has four brick diamond-shaped ventilators and
neither seems to have been heated&mdash;in addition to being open, there are no
chimneys or flues. It is likely that both rooms were used for storage spaces and,
from the evidence in existing doors and windows, secure ones. The overall
measurements of the building are approximately thirty-four feet eight inches by ten
feet ten inches, each end room measuring approximately eleven feet eleven inches
by ten feet ten inches.</p>

<p>The necessary, a privy or outdoor toilet, occupies the central recessed portion
between the two end storage rooms. It measures approximately ten feet ten inches
by five feet five inches, and includes separate men's and women's sections.</p>

<p>Brick in the structure has an average size of nine inches by four and one-quarter
inches by two and one-quarter inches. The bond is common, varying from three
courses of stretchers to one of headers at the foundations, to five to one at the
gable end. Queen closers are used at the corners of the structure. The cornice line is
three bricks deep, stepped outward. The bottom and top course are stretchers,
while the middle course is set at an angle in a saw-tooth pattern,<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> the same cornice
as is used on the house.</p>

<p>The structure is symmetrical. Brick ventilators, two in each gable end and two to
the rear of each end section, are worked into the brick wall. They are in the shape
of a flattened diamond, with sixteen headers eliminated to form the pattern.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>To the rear of the structure the roof has been replaced, though the front part of
the ridge is old. This may be accounted for by the fact that the rear wall is bowed
back two or three inches out of plumb. This may be immediately seen in the joint
of the wall dividing the storage room on the left from the necessary. This shift
could have necessitated the replacement of the roof to the rear.</p>

<p>Hand wrought, rose head nails were used in the construction of the doors to the
necessary; they may have been used for their clenching properties. The latches are
hand wrought, or at least one of the early fabrications. The left door consists of
three vertical boards, from left to right; nine, ten and eleven inches in width. The
center board is beaded on each side, while the outer boards are undecorated.</p>

<p>Hand wrought rose head nails are also used in the construction of the barred
windows in the front of the storage rooms. Here they are used structurally, tho the
effect is decorative. The bars are iron, and the original frame and bars remain in the
left storage unit window.</p>

<p>The storage rooms have dirt floors and unfinished ceilings. Bars at the windows,
strong doors and the open ventilators would indicate storage areas needing light,
ventilation and security. Such an area might be required for any number of farm
produced commodities.</p>

<p>Both necessaries, in the center portion, are completely finished, with plaster
walls, well shaped seats, windows with sash and glass, and brick floors, now covered
with concrete. The necessary for men to the right has one seat, while that for
women, to the left, has three. Two of these are at ordinary height, while the third is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
at a child's height. The necessary was cleaned from the rear. A tray, inserted
beneath a log sill at the foundation line, could be removed, cleaned and reinserted
daily.</p>

<p>Part of the lath in the ceiling of the necessary is split; there has been some
replacement with sawn lath. Lath nails in a piece of split lath removed from the
ceiling probably postdate 1830, while nails used in the seats are cut and probably
postdate 1840. The significance of dating these nails is minimal as the interiors
could have been finished at any time after the construction of the building.</p>

<p>The ceiling and columns of the recessed entrance to the necessaries were recently
replaced by the present owners, the Amlongs. They replaced the round columns
with square posts. The brick floor laid in a herringbone pattern, if not original, is
certainly early.</p>

<p>In the absence of documentary material it is difficult to date this structure. It
would probably be safe to say that it was built as early as the house, c. 1820, and
possibly before.</p>


<p class="center p2 medium">The Icehouse</p>

<p>The icehouse, located sixty-six feet northwest of the mansion, is one of the most
striking structures at Huntley, and one that differs from most other Virginia
icehouses known to the author. It exhibits quality of design and workmanship
seldom seen in a utilitarian structure. Most icehouses are square, a simple form
which would offer easier construction than the round structure at Huntley. Not
only is this structure round, but the roof is hemispherical, forming a complete
circular dome. Construction of the dome is all headers. Some of the bricks are fired
to a dark color but there is no discernible pattern in the brick work.</p>

<p>All of the structure is below ground. At the top of the dome is a square opening
of quarried stone which is at ground level. The stone here shows the wear of ropes
which were used to lower and raise ice. Most other ice houses are at least partially
above ground, with some type of superstructure, or reveted into a bank or side of a
hill.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> They require some depth, and insulation, so that they are usually finished in
brick or stone. Sawdust was an ingredient commonly used for storing ice, used in
alternating layers of block ice and sawdust. Sawdust was certainly used in the
icehouse at Huntley, and has covered the floor to such an extent that it is not
possible to determine the original depth of the structure. Walking on the present
"floor" gives one somewhat the same feeling as walking on a peat bog. The distance
is at least twelve feet from the present floor level to the entrance at the top of the
dome, and approximately fifteen and one-half feet in diameter.</p>

<p>The dome is strong enough to support the Amlong automobile, which is parked
above it in a recently constructed carport. Access to the icehouse may be had
directly from the adjacent root cellar. One stone step exists, in the root cellar wall.
There may have been a ladder or wooden steps at one time. The walls between the
root cellar and icehouse are separate, indicating that the two structures were
constructed at different dates.</p>


<p class="center p2 medium">The Root Cellar</p>

<p>This building, located fifty feet northwest of the mansion and adjacent to the
icehouse, consists of a one story brick structure above ground, approximately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
fifteen feet two inches square, with a full cellar below ground level. Access to the
cellar is through steep steps of rough cut stone, located on the right side of the
structure. Access to the icehouse is directly opposite.</p>

<p>Evidence of ventilators can be seen on both front and rear. These were barred
openings approximately six inches deep with vents to the surface, which were
finished with brick and faced with quarried stone at ground level. The bars are now
gone, but they were horizontal, instead of vertical as are those in the storage rooms
adjacent to the necessary and of approximately the same size. There is no shelving
or other built-in furniture to indicate the use of the cellar. Since the room above
and the roof are replacements, there is little indication of actual use, and the name
"root cellar" has been used only for convenience.</p>

<p>The cellar walls are brick, laid in common bond, with three courses of stretchers
to one of headers. This bond is uniform for the structure, above and below ground.
The average size of bricks is eight and three-eighths by four by two and one-half
inches. The plain cornice is uniform, probably indicating that the roof was
originally hipped.</p>

<p>With the exception of the brick walls, which stand substantially as constructed,
the structure has been entirely rebuilt. Windows in these walls are set into brick
arches which are decorative rather than structural. The recessed windows of the
building like those in the mansion house are of particular interest.</p>


<p class="center p2 medium">Dairy and Springs</p>

<p>A dairy or springhouse is located at the base of the hill, some one hundred
fifty-six feet southeast of the mansion house, near the point where the south
driveway to Huntley meets Harrison Lane. This spring, and the one immediately
across the road, form the source of the south branch of Little Hunting Creek, from
which derived the early name of Huntley, "Hunting Creek Farm." The springhouse
is brick, now overgrown and filled almost completely so that there is no flow of
water and original use is difficult to ascertain. The structure may have had a door
and shelves in the brick wall. The roof is arched, one brick course deep, and the
structure is reveted into the hillside.</p>

<p>There is another spring on the hill to the northwest above the mansion house.
This, too, is encased with bricks, all below ground, and could have furnished water
to the house through gravity flow. Since both this cistern type spring and the
springhouse below the mansion house are probably contemporary, the lower one
may have served exclusively as a dairy.</p>

<p>At least two other springs or shallow wells also exist on the property, providing
the headwaters for Barnyard Creek, and for part of Dogue Creek.</p>


<p class="center p2 medium">Early Structures No Longer Standing</p>

<p>Though barns existed until the 1950's, none of these, as evidenced by
photographs, would seem to date from the period of construction of the house.
Some one hundred seventy-one feet west of the tenant house, and in a straight line
with the main house, are the remains of a large brick foundation. This foundation
supported a sizeable structure in the Huntley complex, which may have been a
barn. The ruins are rectangular, and approximately thirty-three by sixty feet.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>None of the storage rooms in the outbuildings show any evidence of ever having
been used as a smoke house, though the structure over the root cellar may have
been used for that purpose. It has been completely remodeled inside, including a
floor and roof, and any evidence of smoke house use has been eradicated. Though
one would expect to find, in a complete southern plantation complex, barns, slave
quarters, and a smoke house, none of these now exist at Huntley, as is the case with
most surviving eighteenth and nineteenth century mansions.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="center large">THE ARCHITECT OF HUNTLEY</p>


<p>The construction of Huntley was probably not supervised by an architect. There
are too many imperfections for that. At the same time, it is too architectonic to
have either evolved or been put together from style manuals. It is likely instead that
the building derived from an architect's plan.</p>


<p class="center p2 medium">The Architectural Plan</p>

<p>The mansion house at Huntley has remarkable refinement for a secondary house
of a Virginia planter's family. This includes not only concept, scale, and the manner
in which the component parts hold together, but extends to detail as well. For
example, both the center first floor room and the east wing have corner blocks, of
two different designs, as a part of door and window architraves. The architect
Benjamin Latrobe used corner blocks, for which the drawings still exist, in some of
the rooms at Decatur House in 1818.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> Fiske Kimball, the architectural historian,
believes that:</p>

<blockquote><p>In the Forrester House and the Andrew House there [Salem,
Massachusetts] at this time [1818], and in the Decatur House,
Washington, just before, we find the first examples of doors framed,
not by a mitred architrave, but by moulded bands with corner blocks,
which remained characteristic through the middle of the Century.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>That Huntley, c. 1820, should have corner blocks, is probably too much to
expect from a local carpenter's design, if Mr. Kimball's dates are correct. Inasmuch
as the corner blocks are an integral part of the design of the center first floor room
at Huntley, there can be no question that they were original. It is interesting to
note that at Decatur House, as at Huntley and Arlington, corner blocks are used
only in some rooms, and not uniformly throughout the house, as is common later.</p>

<p>Of course, Thomson Francis Mason could have had easy access to the works of
Gibbs, Morris, Benjamin and others. George Mason IV had enough knowledge of
architecture and design to employ William Buckland to design the interiors at
Gunston Hall and his library was extensive. Mrs. Rowland, in speculating on what
was in that library, notes that it was divided among his five sons, including T. F.'s
father, and further notes that:</p>

<blockquote><p>The editor of the "Spotswood Letters" notices the libraries, really
extensive for the time, of the second William Byrd of "Westover," of
Sir John Randolph of Williamsburg, and of John Mercer of "Marlboro,"
and numerous others nearly as large, among them that of George Mason
of Gunston.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Books might have given Mason an appreciation and knowledge of architecture
and design, but it is highly unlikely that the design for Huntley derived from a
book. In discussing the design of houses in this period architect Robert Mills noted
in his "Autobiographical Notes" that:</p>

<blockquote><p>The principle assumed and acted upon was that beauty is founded upon
order, and that convenience and utility were constituent parts ... the
author has made it a rule never to consult books when he had to design
a building. His considerations were first, the object of the building;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
second, the means appropriated for its construction; third, the situation
it was to occupy; these served as guides in forming the outlines of his
plan. Books are useful guides to the student, but when he entered on
the practice of a profession, he should lay them aside and only consult
them upon doubtful points, or in matters of details or, as mere studies,
not to copy buildings from.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>At Huntley the designer certainly considered convenience and utility, while keeping
in mind "the object of the building ... the means appropriated for its
construction" and "the situation it was to occupy."</p>


<p class="center p2 medium">Area Architects, Circa 1820</p>

<p>During the first quarter of the nineteenth century, Dr. William Thornton,
Charles Bulfinch, Robert Mills, Benjamin Latrobe and George Hadfield were all
designing buildings in the stylistic mode of Huntley. Mason would have been aware
of Dr. Thornton's work at Tudor Place in Georgetown, completed about 1815, and
at Woodlawn Plantation, near Huntley, completed about 1805. Though Thornton
did not die until 1828, he was already an elderly man by 1820, and Tudor Place is
the last house he is known to have designed.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>Mason would have been aware of Bulfinch's work from his visits to Boston, and
Bulfinch arrived in this area in 1817. He immediately busied himself as Architect of
the United States Capitol, however.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> Robert Mills studied in Washington with
Latrobe, and later designed buildings here, but he was not in Washington at the
time Huntley was built.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> Latrobe, who died in 1820, was at the height of his career
and had ample commissions in the period of time from 1810-20. Hadfield, on the
other hand, was available, needed work,<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> and had not yet begun his City Hall.
Huntley would have provided not only suitable work, but a challenging site, and a
suitable family for whom to work.</p>


<p class="center p2 medium">George Hadfield</p>

<p>Hadfield, a British subject, was born in Leghorn, Italy, about 1764.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> His
architectural training and collection of architectural prizes were outstanding when
he arrived in this country in 1795 to superintend the construction of the United
States Capitol. He, and his sister Maria Cosway, a painter, were both friends of
Thomas Jefferson. Jefferson championed Hadfield here, though his actual
recommendation to the Capitol job was from John Trumbull, the American artist.
Soon difficulties began with Dr. William Thornton, who had won the competition
for design of the Capitol and Hadfield lost his job.</p>

<blockquote><p>From the time of Hadfield's dismissal from the Capitol in 1798, until
1820, when he was busy with his <i>magnum opus</i>, the City Hall, the
records are sketchy and incomplete. He elected to stay in this city
rather than go to Philadelphia where the social and political centers
were. This decision must have been made deliberately, with the
prospect of designing many buildings in this growing metropolis. He
was without a steady income during all this period, yet he was able to
keep busy on many jobs that enabled him to stay alive.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Hadfield was obviously not always happy with the commissions which came his
way, however. On September 22, 1822, he wrote Jefferson:</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p>... am much obliged to you Sir, for the wish you express to inform my
Sister that I am in good health and doing well: the former, thanks to
Providence, I enjoy; as to the latter, I cannot say much; there is here a
stagnation in the building line, owing to the scarcity of money, that is
very injurious to both architects and mechanics. I have for the two
preceding seasons been occupied in the building of the City Hall....<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>We know little of what Hadfield accomplished in Washington, though his
obituary, in 1826, gives some leads:</p>

<blockquote><p>It is a duty we owe to the founders of our city, when any of them are
called from the scene of their former usefulness, to do honor to their
memory, by recording with truth, whatever they have done in laying
the foundations of our infant metropolis, or promoting its welfare. It is
but doing justice to the dead; and it is to be hoped, when such men die,
that it will excite the living to emulate them. Amongst this class may be
placed the late Mr. GEORGE HADFIELD, <i>Architect</i>, who died at his
residence in this city, on Sunday evening, the 5th instant, aged about
62 years....</p></blockquote>

<p>The obituary notes that Mr. Hadfield never married, mentions his early training and
prizes, his arrival in Washington to superintend the construction of the Capitol and
the subsequent arguments. His accomplishments were summarized:</p>

<blockquote><p>Amongst the works which will serve to perpetuate his memory in this
city are the City Hall; the Public Offices, which were built from his
design; Mr. Custis's house [Arlington House]; Com. Porter's; Mr. Way's
Row, now occupied by Mr. Gunton and others; Heightman's Row, now
occupied by Mr. Poor and others; Col. Taylor's, now Williamson's Hotel;
the Mausoleum, built for the families of Van Ness and Burns; and the
Branch Bank of the United States. It is only to be regretted that there
are so few remains of his uncommon talents.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>There are "remains of his uncommon talents" which are not in that list. Hadfield
is known, for example, to have provided plans and designs for the Marine Barracks
in Washington.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> There are also good reasons to believe that he designed Analostan,
located on what is now called Theodore Roosevelt Island, for John Mason,
Thomson Francis Mason's uncle.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>


<p class="center p2 medium">Similarities to the Work of Hadfield</p>

<p>Among the few known drawings of Hadfield is one labelled "A Country House&mdash;Geo.
Hadfield&mdash;Exhibited Arc. designs at Royal acad. in 1780-82...."<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> The
house is of three-part construction and has windows set into arched recessed panels.
Arlington House (Custis-Lee Mansion) is of three-part construction and has
windows set into arched recessed panels.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> The City Hall in Washington, now the
District of Columbia Court House, is of three-part construction, with connecting
hyphens, and has windows set into arched recessed panels.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> The same is true of
the plan for Analostan, though one wing evidently was never constructed.</p>

<p>Huntley, too, is of three-part construction and though the windows are not set
into arched recessed panels, they are set into the center of square recessed panels,
which serve the same design function of catching and reflecting light and shadow.
The recessed arch appears at Huntley in the root cellar superstructure, however,
duplicating Hadfield's use in the structures mentioned above.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>Arlington House has a two story center section with one story wings, as does
Huntley. It is possible that had Huntley been built on different terrain, it might
have followed the more common "I" plan of Arlington House. Given the limited
space on Huntley's hill, however, the "H" plan obviously made more usable space
available on the site. The chimneys at Arlington, and those at Huntley, are placed in
the same position in relation to the center structure and the wings; the wooden
mantels in both houses have obvious stylistic similarities.</p>

<p>When Huntley is compared with Analostan another similarity shows up. The
gable end at Analostan has a relatively shallow cornice, common in the period,
outlining a pediment strikingly similar to the gable ends of the wings at Huntley.
Located within the pediment at both houses is an elliptical ventilator.</p>

<p>The design for Huntley could easily have come from Hadfield. There were
opportunities for T.F. Mason to have met him through Jefferson or through his
uncle, General John Mason of Analostan.</p>

<p>George Washington Parke Custis of Arlington House and Thomson Mason of
Hollin Hall were both sheep raisers and there was much rivalry between the two
families in this field, including Mason entries which took prizes at Custis exhibitions
and shows.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> This offers, in addition to the day-to-day opportunities presented to
Mason through his political and social standing, one more means whereby T.F.
Mason might have learned of Hadfield, observed his work, met him, and contracted
for design assistance in the construction of his country house.</p>

<p>In addition, Mason was a lawyer, who later became a justice of the peace and a
judge. For several years before and after 1820, Hadfield was involved with the
design and construction of the City Hall, which was to house the Courts of the
District. Mason would have been aware of this and would probably have known
Hadfield.</p>

<p>Certainly the design evidence of Huntley indicates the work of an architect. The
structure is much too architectonic to have evolved and in many respects much too
advanced for its day to have been designed by a local carpenter-builder. Perhaps at
some future time we shall discover information which indicates precisely whose
trained hand put all the pieces together in this highly satisfactory manner.</p>

<p>Until that time, the evidence strongly points to George Hadfield.</p>

<h2 class="p4">SUMMARY</h2>


<p>It should be clear from the picture of Mason which emerges from an earlier part
of this report that his tastes and his capabilities could have included a house
designed by a known architect. His family ties, educational background, travels,
position and social standing evidence the highest standards of his day. His
acquisition of Colross, his sensitive repairs of that structure and the manner in
which he seems to have furnished the house again indicate taste and awareness of
current architectural trends.</p>

<p>The design evidence indicates that Mason did build well at Huntley, and that he
sought assistance in doing so. Huntley's similarities to other area structures designed
by the architect George Hadfield are striking. In addition, of all the architects in the
area at the time Hadfield was most available and is believed to have already
designed one house for the Mason family, Analostan. There is also good reason to
believe that Thomson Francis Mason and Hadfield knew each other.</p>

<p>Whatever the derivation of the mansion house at Huntley, it survives as a notable
example of early nineteenth century architecture; as an example of a farm or
country house of an early nineteenth century city dweller; as a Mason family house
and as a part of a well sited and relatively complete complex. When considered
together, these factors make Huntley an important architectural landmark.</p>

<h2 class="p4">APPENDIX A</h2>

<p class="center large">SOME MASON HOUSES IN NORTHERN VIRGINIA</p>

<p>Mason land holdings were vast in Stafford, Prince William, Loudoun and Fairfax
Counties in Virginia, and in Maryland and Kentucky. In the northern Virginia area
the Masons built or occupied a number of houses many of which are mentioned
here.</p>


<p class="center p2 medium">Thomson Francis Mason Houses</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in"><i>501 Cameron Street</i>, Alexandria. This is believed to be the "large and
comodious" dwelling which, according to an 1823 entry in the <i>Alexandria Gazette</i>,
Mason was renting at the corner of Cameron and Pitt Streets. The house is a
three-story brick structure, probably built during the first quarter of the nineteenth
century. It is still standing. (<i>Alexandria Gazette</i>, March 13, 1823 and November 1,
1833.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in"><i>Colross</i>, Alexandria, 1100 block of Oronoco Street, block between Oronoco,
Pendleton, North Henry and North Fayette. This was an existing house built in the
last quarter of the eighteenth century, acquired by Thomson F. Mason in 1833.
Mason was buried in a tomb behind the mansion after his death in 1838. The main
house was moved to Princeton, New Jersey, in 1929 and rebuilt there. Today the
block in Alexandria includes a warehouse, car wash, automobile repair facility and a
transformer station. The present location of the remains of Thomson F. Mason,
removed from Colross, is not known to the writer. (Mary G. Powell, <i>The History of
Alexandria</i>, Va., Richmond, Wm. Byrd Press, 1928, p. 261; <i>New York Herald
Tribune</i>, July 7, 1929, "Colross Built 1785, to come to Jersey site."; Mrs. Betty
Carter Smoot, <i>Days in an Old Town</i>, Alexandria, privately printed, 1934, pp.
121-32; Henry H. Saylor, <i>Alexandria Virginia</i>, The White Pine Series, New York,
Russell F. Whitehead, 1926, (photographs and drawings); plus additional material
available in the Alexandria Public Library.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in"><i>The Hallowell School</i>, 609 Oronoco Street, Alexandria. A two-and-a-half-story
brick structure, built circa 1800, it is the companion house to the Lee Home, next
door at 607 Oronoco. At 609, Benjamin Hallowell operated a school among whose
students was Robert E. Lee. T.F. Mason acquired the house after the Hallowell
School moved elsewhere, at public auction on February 9, 1835, though he may
have lived there earlier as a tenant. By the time of purchase he was already a
resident at Colross, but a sale advertisement for 609 Oronoco Street in 1839 calls it
" ... the late residence of the Honorable T. F. Mason ...". The house is still
standing. (Deering Davis, Stephen P. Dorsey and Ralph Cole Hall, <i>Alexandria
Houses</i>, Cornwall, N.Y. Architectural Book Publishing Co., Inc., 1946, pp. 88-89,
126; Benjamin Hallowell, <i>Autobiography</i>, Philadelphia, Friends Book Association,
1884, pp. 95-120. <i>Alexandria Gazette</i>, August 30, 1839,; Alexandria Deed Book
V-2, p. 355(1835).)</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in"><i>Huntley</i>, 6918 Harrison Lane, Groveton, Fairfax County. Still standing. Though
Huntley was built during Mason's ownership of the property, no record has been
found that he actually lived there.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in"><i>115 South St. Asaph Street</i>, Alexandria, is a two-and-one-half-story brick
structure over an English basement built about 1800, and still standing. A sign on
the structure says "Home of Thomas Mason, circa 1775." It was purchased by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
Mason in May of 1832, at about the same time that he purchased the lot next door
at 117 S. St. Asaph Street. A three-story structure of the last quarter of the
nineteenth century now stands there. Mason may have been a tenant at 115 before
his purchase, but was already out of the house by November 8, 1833, when a Dr.
Wheelwright announced that he had "... removed to the house on St. Asaph
Street ... formerly occupied by Thomson F. Mason, Esq." (Deering Davis, Stephen
P. Dorsey &amp; Ralph Cole Hall, <i>Alexandria Houses</i>, Cornwall, N.Y., Architectural
Book Publishing Co., Inc., 1946, p. 126; <i>Alexandria Gazette</i>, November 8, 1833.
Alexandria Deed Books: U-2, p. 27 (1832); U-2, p. 29 (1832); and M-3, p. 646
(1852).)</p>

<p>This list includes only part of the real estate owned by Thomson Francis Mason.
He lived in the Cameron Street house during the 1820's. He may have lived in either
the Oronoco Street or St. Asaph Street houses before he purchased them. At any
rate, he purchased Colross, Hallowell School and the St. Asaph Street houses in the
decade before his death. He died in 1838 and was buried at Colross. There are long
periods of time unaccounted for and probably many real estate transactions which
have not yet been documented.</p>


<p class="center p2 medium">Other Mason Houses</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in"><i>Analostan</i>, home of General John Mason. Located on the Potomac River in the
District of Columbia on Theodore Roosevelt Island, known in the past as
Barbadoes, Mason's Island, or Analostan. Built in the 1790's, its design is attributed
to George Hadfield. General Mason sold the house about 1833 and moved to
Clermont. Parts of the Analostan house stood until the 1930's when they were
demolished by the Theodore Roosevelt Memorial Association. (<i>Sunday Star</i>, Feb.
6, 1921, Rambler "... History of Analostan Island;" <i>Star</i>, June 4, 1958, Rambler,
"Revisits Analostan Island;" <i>Virginia Record</i>, July 1956, p. 9, Mollie Somerville,
"George Mason's Island;" Rowland, <i>George Mason</i>, New York, Russell &amp; Russell,
1892 and 1946, Vol I, p. 117; Harry F. Cunningham, Joseph A. Younger, and J.
Wilmer Smith, <i>Measured Drawings of Georgian Architecture in the District of
Columbia</i>, 1750-1820, New York, Architectural Book Company 1914, Sheets
58-61.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in"><i>Clermont</i>, which was purchased by General John Mason and to which he and his
family moved in 1833. Site near Fairfax County-Alexandria line, off Clermont
Drive, near point where the Richmond, Fredericksburg &amp; Potomac tracks cross
Cameron Run. It was demolished in the 19th Century. ("Diary of Miss Mason,"
beginning Sept. 20th 1833, property of Mrs. Augustus Thorndike, partial copy in
Gunston Hall archives (Analostan file); Christine Gibson unpublished report,
Fairfax County Public Library, Virginiana Collection.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in"><i>Gunston Hall</i>, home of George Mason IV, in Fairfax County. The house is a
one-and-one-half-story brick structure, with interiors by William Buckland joiner
and architect. In the garden is one of America's best surviving stands of English
Boxwood. The house still stands on Route 242, 4 miles southeast of Route 1, and
south of Fort Belvoir. It is owned by the Commonwealth of Virginia and
administered as an historic house museum by a Board of Regents of the National
Society of Colonial Dames. (Thomas Tileston Waterman, <i>The Mansions of Virginia</i>,
Chapel Hill, University of North Carolina Press, 1946.)</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in"><i>Hollin Hall</i>, built for and occupied by General Thomson Mason, son of George
Mason IV of Gunston Hall, and father of T.F. Mason. It was a two-story frame
structure, which burned early in the nineteenth century. Part of the complex may
still exist, or be incorporated into the present structure known as Little Hollin Hall
at 1901 Sherwood Hall Lane, in Fairfax County south of Alexandria. (Rowland,
<i>George Mason</i>, New York, Russell &amp; Russell, 1892 and 1946, Volume II, pps. 307,
351, and numerous others; <i>Hollin Hills Bulletin</i>, May 1969, June-July, 1969.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in"><i>Lexington</i>, in Fairfax County, built for George Mason V, son of George of
Gunston Hall and uncle of T.F. Mason. The house stood on Mason Neck, near
Gunston Hall. The structure burned in the nineteenth century. (Rowland, <i>George
Mason</i>, New York, Russell &amp; Russell, 1892 and 1946, Volume I, p. 112; Edith
Moore Sprouse, <i>Lexington</i>, unpublished report, June 1967, Virginiana Files,
Fairfax County Public Library.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in"><i>Okeley</i>, home of Richard Chichester Mason, brother of T.F. Mason. The
structure was destroyed during the Civil War. It was located in Fairfax County on S.
Kings Highway, just south of Huntley. (Rowland, <i>George Mason</i>, New York,
Russell &amp; Russell, 1892 and 1946, Volume II, p. 473; <i>Alexandria Gazette</i>, March
30, 1841).</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in"><i>Spring Bank</i>, owned by George Mason, son of William Mason and first cousin of
T.F. Mason. There may have been an earlier structure on the site, but the house in
which this George Mason lived is a two-story brick structure, built about 1850,
which is still standing. It is located at Penn Daw in Fairfax County in the Spring
Bank Trailer Park, at the intersection of Kings Highway and the Jefferson Davis
Highway (Route 1). (Rowland, <i>George Mason</i>, New York, Russell &amp; Russell, 1892
and 1946, Volume II, pps. 366, 369, and others.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in"><i>Woodbridge</i>, home of Thomas, son of George of Gunston Hall, and uncle of T.F.
Mason. It stood in Prince William County almost directly across Occoquan River
from Colchester and was demolished prior to 1892. (Rowland, <i>George Mason</i>, New
York, Russell &amp; Russell, 1892 and 1946, Volume I, p. 112.)</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>
